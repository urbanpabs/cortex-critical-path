**Purpose:** Experimental visualization page for Platform Engineering as Code — showing the "Digital Thread" concept where a single commit triggers a chain reaction across infrastructure.

**Sections Created:**
1. **The Digital Thread (Commit to Production)**
   - Animated flow: Coder → CI/CD → Kafka → Kratix → Apigee → Cortex
   - Each node shows role ("The Blueprint", "The Messenger", "The Orchestrator", etc.)
   - "As code" file representation for each component
   - Animated pulse traveling along the thread path

2. **The Layered Cake View (Stack Architecture)**
   - Experience Layer: Cortex + Coder (catalog.yaml, workspace.tf)
   - Logic Layer: Kratix + Kafka (promise.yaml, topic-config.json)
   - Infrastructure Layer: K8s + Apigee (deployment.yaml, proxy-bundle.zip)

3. **Self-Healing MTTR Visualization**
   - 5-step recovery flow when a "stitch" breaks
   - Timeline: Detection → Signal → Reaction → Resolution → Result
   - 4-minute total recovery time
   - No human intervention required

4. **Force Multiplier Visual (200 vs 13,000)**
   - 200 Platform Engineers ("Engine Designers") — write Promises, Kafka Streams, Apigee Policies
   - 13,000 Application Developers ("Drivers") — use Coder Workspaces, browse Cortex, one-click deploy

5. **Visualization Checklist**
   - Kafka in the Middle (The Bus)
   - Kratix as the Brain (The Logic)
   - Apigee as the Shield (The Gateway)
   - Coder as the Starting Line (The Workspace)

**Note:** Page is accessible via direct URL but button removed from index.html navigation for future work.

### Session: January 24, 2026 — Cake Delivery Visualization

#### New Page: Cake Delivery (`cake-delivery.html`)

**Concept:** Visualizes the Portal to Platform Engineering as a three-layer cake (Coder, Cortex, Kratix) and communicates the importance of vertical slicing vs horizontal slicing for delivery.

**The Cake Metaphor:**

| Layer | Product | Role | Description |
|-------|---------|------|-------------|
| Top | Coder | The Frosting | What developers touch first — workspaces, templates, IDE |
| Middle | Cortex | The Filling | The rich middle — catalog, scorecards, workflows |
| Bottom | Kratix | The Base | The foundation — promises, Harness, orchestration |

**Key Message:** "Bake Your Layer, But Deliver Together"
- Each team owns their layer of the cake
- But we don't serve layers — we serve **slices**
- Every slice cuts through all three products to deliver end-to-end value

**Horizontal vs Vertical Slicing:**

| Approach | Description | Outcome |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Horizontal (Anti-pattern) | Complete each layer before integration | No value until all complete, late integration, silos |
| Vertical (Goal) | Deliver thin end-to-end slices | Immediate value, early integration, collaboration |

**Delivery Roadmap Slices:**

| Phase | Slice Name | Capabilities |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| Phase 0 | Foundation Slice: Java on AKS | Java, Maven, Rolling, Containers, AKS |
| Phase 1 | Visibility Slice: Scorecards + Intelligence | Production Readiness, Security, DORA, One-Touch |
| Phase 2 | Multi-Cloud Slice: Java on EKS | EKS Promises, Blue-Green, Cross-Cloud Catalog |
| Scale | Full Stack Slices | All languages, strategies, 1,690 apps |

**Visual Elements:**
- 3D perspective cake with layered products
- Side-by-side horizontal vs vertical slicing comparison
- Timeline roadmap with phase markers
- Closing message with quote: "Nobody wants a mouthful of frosting. They want the whole slice."

#### Index Page Navigation Update

**New Button Added (Row 2, after Platform Journey):**
```html
<a href="cake-delivery.html" class="nav-btn">
    <span>🍰</span>

</a>
```

#### Project Files Update

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `cake-delivery.html` | NEW | Cake metaphor visualization for vertical slicing delivery |
| `index.html` | UPDATED | Added Cake Delivery navigation link |
